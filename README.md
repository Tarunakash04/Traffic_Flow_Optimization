# Traffic flow optimizer

This project implements a **traffic flow optimizer** using **FASTag RFID detection**. Vehicles are detected via their FASTag, and data is transmitted to a backend for processing. The system dynamically adjusts traffic signal timing based on vehicle count.

---

## ðŸš€ Features  
- **Vehicle Detection**: Uses FASTag data to detect vehicles in real-time.  
- **Traffic Signal Optimization**: Adjusts signal timings based on the number of vehicles per lane.  
- **Data Transmission**: Uses HTTP (POST requests) to send vehicle data.  
- **Lane-Specific Processing**: Computes green time dynamically for each lane. .
